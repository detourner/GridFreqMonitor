# GridFreqMonitor
This project configures a Raspberry Pi to measure the electrical grid frequency (50 Hz) in real-time and streams the data via a WebSocket server. Written in Python, it enables live monitoring of power grid stability and frequency variations for analysis or integration with other systems.
